# Home Server Project Rules

## Key Scripts (Most Important)
- deploy.sh: Deploys all stacks in order (infra → media → homeassistant → paperless → budget → budibase)
- undeploy.sh: Stops all stacks in reverse order
- pull.sh: Updates system (stops service → git pull → docker pull → restart service → show logs)
- backup_volumes.sh: Creates tar.gz backups of all home-server_* volumes in ~/volume_backups/YYYYMMDD/
- fix-rclone.sh: Resets rclone plugin (requires confirmation, undeploys stacks, removes volumes)

## Project Structure
- Docker-based home server with multiple stacks
- Managed via systemd service (home-server-compose.service)
- Uses Docker Compose for stack management

## Core Stacks
- infra: Infrastructure services
- media: Media services
- homeassistant: Home automation
- paperless: Document management (includes Ofelia for task scheduling)
- budget: Personal finance tracking (Actual Budget)
- budibase: Low-code platform

## Task Scheduling
- Ofelia service in paperless stack manages scheduled tasks across all stacks
- Paperless stack must be deployed last to ensure Ofelia can detect all containers
- Services can be scheduled using Ofelia labels:
  - ofelia.enabled: "true"
  - ofelia.job-exec.datecron.schedule: "@daily" (or other cron expressions)
  - ofelia.job-exec.datecron.command: "command to run"

## Environment
- Uses .env files for configuration
- Requires Docker and systemd
- Volumes prefixed with 'home-server_'
